## About Blog
Born out of curiosity.

## About the website logo
The website logo is motivated from the concept of an [ambigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram). My idea for creating this logo was to read as `OM` (refers to [ॐ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om)) in one orientation and read as `विद्या` ([Vidya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidya_(philosophy)) in sanskrit means true knowledge) after rotating it by 180 deg. Here is the crude effort I made.

**color code used**:\\
Saffron: `#FF9933`; Navy blue: `#000080`; Green: `#138808`
{: .notice--info}
The saffron-colored part on the left is a feather representing a quill pen.
### About Vidya
In sanskrit, there is a shloka (verse) on vidya, which says:

विद्यां ददाति विनयं,
विनयाद् याति पात्रताम्।
पात्रत्वात् धनमाप्नोति,
धनात् धर्मं ततः सुखम्॥

Vidya shows us to be humble; Humbleness leads to character. Character shows us the path to wealth; Wealth leads us to a righteous life;  From righteousness, we get happiness.
