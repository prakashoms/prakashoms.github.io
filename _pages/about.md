## About Blog
I always used to think that it must be cool to have a website of your own. So, finally, I have tried my best to make one. Once I attended a talk by [Prof. T. DebRoy](https://www.matse.psu.edu/directory/tarasankar-debroy) about the *importance of peer-reviewed articles* in Dec’19. He mentioned that being a researcher, it is very much required that one should have a habit of reading and writing articles. Well, I try my best to read, but writing peer-reviewed articles, although done once in a while, is still an exhausting process. So, here, I created this [blog](/blog/) to write about my observations of some research related concepts I come by. Nonetheless, I would also try to write about social and other interesting kinds of stuff. Since I am a beginner to all these website-blog things, I would very much appreciate getting any constructive feedback on my posts. **Thank you**.

## About the website logo
The website logo is motivated from the concept of an [ambigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram). My idea for creating this logo was to read as `OM` (refers to [ॐ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om)) in one orientation and read as `विद्या` ([Vidya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidya_(philosophy)) in sanskrit means true knowledge) after rotating it by 180 deg. Here is the crude effort I made.

**color code used**:\\
Saffron: `#FF9933`; Navy blue: `#000080`; Green: `#138808`

The saffron-colored part on the left is a feather representing a quill pen.
### About Vidya
In sanskrit, there is a shloka (verse) on vidya, which says:

विद्यां ददाति विनयं,
विनयाद् याति पात्रताम्।
पात्रत्वात् धनमाप्नोति,
धनात् धर्मं ततः सुखम्॥

Vidya shows us to be humble; Humbleness leads to character. Character shows us the path to wealth; Wealth leads us to a righteous life;  From righteousness, we get happiness.
