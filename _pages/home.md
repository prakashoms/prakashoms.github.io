Om Prakash `(OP)` received his Ph.D. from the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (Mumbai, India) in Aug 2022, where he was a humble part of the Automation Lab.
Just saying Ph.D. without mentioning the topic doesn't make much sense. So, here goes: *Sensor Network design for Chemical Processes* broadly summarized his research work at IIT Bombay.

He made this website out of curiosity. You are most welcome to give any constructive feedback (comments) on his [posts](/blog/). Also, you can check out the Automation Lab [guide-student network](/automationlab-network/) created in D3.js. You will have fun playing with the graph.

OP likes coding, trekking, running, engaging in several sports activities, capturing photos through his lenses (visit his [photography page](/photography/)), learning about one or two new things, listening to Bollywood melodies, and watching action movies on his old laptop, which he borrowed from his sister a long time back. Well, he is not an expert in whatever he does, but he is keen to learn. Last but not least, I am still wondering why I wrote this para in 3rd person. <i class="far fa-grin-beam"></i>

**Thank you for visiting the website**.
