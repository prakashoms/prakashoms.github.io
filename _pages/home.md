Om Prakash `(OP)` is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (Mumbai, India), where he is a humble part of the Automation Lab.
Just saying Ph.D. without mentioning the topic doesn't make much sense. So, here goes: the title of his thesis - *Sensor Network design for Chemical Processes*.

He made this website because he wanted to express his thoughts; sometimes, it also helps him to understand some concepts. You are most welcome to give any constructive feedback (comments) on his [posts](/blog/). Also, you can check out the Automation Lab [guide-student network](/automationlab-network/) created in D3.js. You will have fun playing with the graph.

OP likes coding, trekking, capturing photos through his lenses (visit his [photography page](/photography/)), running, learning about one or two new things, listening to Bollywood melodies, and watching action movies on his old laptop, which he borrowed from his sister a long time back. Well, whatever he does, he is not an expert in those, but he is keen to learn. Last but not least, he does not want to talk about himself in the 3rd person. <i class="far fa-grin-beam"></i>

**Thank you for visiting the website**.
