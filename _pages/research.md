    excerpt: "[**Utilizing flared gas for distributed generation: An optimization based approach**](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5096498) <br> Deepika Bishnoi, *Om Prakash*, Harsh Chaturvedi <br>  AIP Conference Proceedings 2091, 020007 (April 2019) <br> <br> A large quantity of natural gas coming out of gas wells is flared or vent out into the atmosphere. Natural gas, primarily composed of methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, poses a more significant threat to the environment. Here, we present an idea to utilize natural gas to convert into electricity in situ for local power requirements. In particular, we present an optimization-based approach to allocating the optimal number of technologies required to generate power and network to distribute power."
